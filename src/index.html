                    <p>The church facades are richly decorated. The curved blind arcading throughout is unaltered from

                        century. <br> <br> The arches genuinely ascend or descend according to height of the

                        remnants can
                        be seen
                        in the western and southeastern parts, as well as under the pillars below the floor. <br> <br>

                        Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, originally built in the 4th century, has been damaged several
                        times during
                        history, notably by the invasions of Arabs, Persians and Timur, and latterly during Russian
                        subjugation and the Soviet period. <br> <br> The building has also been damaged by earthquakes.
